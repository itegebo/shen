        it and charge what you want and distribute it either as
        closed or open source. We'll come back to that.</font></p>

        color="#000000" size="3"> source code which comes with
        the download. You will see that this code carries a
        copyright on the code. The concept of <em>derivative</em>
        is explained in US law as follows.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><em>A &#147;derivative
        work&#148; is a work based upon one or more pre-existing
        works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
        dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
        sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
        condensation, or any other form in which a work may be
        recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
        modifications which, as a whole, represent an original
        work of authorship, is a &#147;derivative work&#148;.</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">To this we add that any

        color="#000000" size="3"> source code to another medium
        i.e. another language; counts as a derivative work in our
        understanding, and it is immaterial <u>whether this
        mapping is done by a human being or by a computer</u>. If
        you map Shen into Javascript by writing a compiler, then
        the resulting Javascript program carries the same license
        as the original and that license must appear on the code.
        If you retitle some of the functions using a global
        substitution it is a derivative work. If you copy it out
        in copperplate using a quill, it is derivative. In other
        words, the message and not the medium is important. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">This is basic. You

        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Shen sources are
        readable for several reasons. The first is that we want
        to allow people to read our code and correct mistakes.
        The second is that people porting Shen to different OSes
        and different platforms need open access to the code to
        do the porting. The last is we allow people to improve
        the efficiency of our code by changing it - <em>as long
        as it then still works</em> i.e. it conforms to the spec.
        You have to put your name on the changes you make,
        because, in the event that something goes wrong, we
        cannot take the moral responsibility for those changes.
        It should be obvious (I hope) that optimising a small
        piece of code does not change the license or allow you to
        change the license. The resulting work is still
        derivative.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Again this emphasises
        what we said in explicating 1. This point just says you
        cannot evade the license by simply retitling and
        reselling our code under a different title e.g. Shine. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">This means you are free
        to add things to Shen which are not part of the standard
        and you can distribute that work under the Shen title. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="4">The Motivation for Shen
        and the License</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Now let's look at the
        motivation for this license. The motivation for the
        license is the motivation for Shen itself; we set
        ourselves a goal and achieved it; we produced a version
        of Qi which runs uniformly according to specification,
        not just under Common Lisp, but under Scheme and
        Javascript (and to come Clojure, Python, ...etc). How did
        we do this? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">First, we did it by
        reducing the instruction set necessary to run Shen to an
        absolute minimum, currently (September, 2011), 45
        primitive functions. Second we maintain a rigorous
        testing and specification for the work we produce and we
        make sure that, under whatever the platform Shen appears,
        Shen runs out of the box on that platform, according to
        spec, <u>without exception</u>. The motto for Shen is:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3"><em>Write
        once, run anywhere.</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">That means that the
        professional programmer can rely on Shen to work for him
        and he can write a Shen program once and move it to CL,
        Javascript etc, and (modulo performance) expect it to
        work. This is very important.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Part of our motivation
        in maintaining a tight spec and a reliable platform is to
        hold the Shen community together so that <u>we do not
        splinter our resources on multiple incompatible forks</u>.
        We do not want multiple incompatible dialects of Shen,
        multiple compilers, multiple incompatible libraries. We
        want $free readable libraries that work for all of us and
        libraries we can pick up and use without worrying about
        compatibility. Hence the production of derivative
        non-conforming programs from our source, whether called
        Shen, Shin, Shine or Shoo, is barred by the license. To
        give up on this is to give up on the motivation for Shen.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">We are therefore not
        open source. Generally, the diversity and freedom to fork
        which was lauded as a strength of open source, has turned
        into the major weakness of Linux. This OS has been
        burdened by multiple forks, multiple distros, multiple
        apps for doing the same thing to the point where
        essentially the same work has been redone over and over
        again by different groups. The resultant wastage of
        effort has been huge and the result has been lack of
        cross platform usability, a lack of uniformity in the
        user interface, a reliance on complex dependencies and
        too often, software that reflects the scattering of human
        resources by displaying broken functionality. Even Linux
        fans are seeing this. This in turn has given Linux a bad
        name. We want to avoid all that.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">The analogy that we
        would like people to carry with them is that of a
        spinning wheel. The freedom of the wheel to spin depends
        on there being a fixed hub which at its theoretical
        geometrical centre point shows zero motion. Our adherence
        to standards and discipline as system programmers allows
        you, the applications programmer, to be confident of
        basing your work on ours.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Some Questions</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">There are probably more
        questions than we can anticipate; hence this list will
        grow as people ask them. Here are a few obvious ones.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">1. <em>Is Shen subject
        to something like GPL? For instance, if I distribute Shen
        source with my application, do I have to make my code
        readable or $free?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">No, any code you write
        using Shen is <em>your </em>code. If it is really an
        application running on top of our code and not a
        derivative of our code, then you can do what you want
        with it. We do not covet your work.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">2. <em>Suppose I write
        a compiler for Shen in C and I want to sell it as closed
        source. Can I? Even if I use your code?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Yes; there is nothing
        to stop you writing a superfast compiler for Shen and
        selling it to people. As long as it meets the language
        specification, we really don't mind.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">3. <em>Suppose I move
        Shen to another platform and make an error, breaking the
        spec, what happens?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Generally you would
        want to avoid breaking the spec, but supposing that you
        did, you would first have to issue an announcement to
        your users explaining there was a bug. Second, you would
        have to fix it. If you could not fix it, you would have
        to withdraw it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">4. <em>Suppose I wanted
        to distribute some enhanced version of Shen e.g. with a
        graphics tool or special editor. Would my work be bound
        by the Shen license?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Again the code you
        write which rides on the top of our code is <em>not</em>
        bound by our license, this is yours. And there is nothing
        to say that you cannot add extra features, bells and
        whistles, to your version of Shen; but what you cannot do
        is add a feature than causes Shen to fail to execute
        according to spec. And you cannot simply get round this
        by retitling the resultant implementation by another
        name. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">5. <em>Can I change
        Shen source and sell it as closed source?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Yes; it's probably not
        a very sound business proposition because we keep our
        sources readable. But you could do that provided the
        result still ran according to spec under the same name.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">6. <em>Can I sell
        support and services to Shen?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Of course.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">7. <em>Will the library
        appear under the same license that Shen uses?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">No; we are pretty much <em>laissez
        faire</em> with respect to applications written in Shen.
        We don't insist on any license restrictions on what
        appears in the library. However if you want to make a
        for-money closed source contribution to the library and
        you wanted us to mount it on our website, you would have
        to negotiate a fee for us giving it space and
        advertising. If you wanted to make it open source, under
        BSD or MIT for instance, then we'd certainly put it up -
        no fee. <u>Generally we are into open source for the
        library</u>, because the motivation for constraint is
        less than for the kernel on which everything depends and
        we want people to be able to use this stuff freely. We
        are into experimentation at this level.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">8. <em>Will the
        standard for Shen remain the same?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">No; no language
        standard remains static. We need to evolve standards for
        calling foreign processes etc.; so we cannot freeze our
        work to what we have achieved in 2011.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">9. <em>So does this
        mean that I could write a program in Shen in 2011 and
        find it does not work in 2013?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Almost certainly not.
        We don't intend to remove or change what we have already
        done. Changes will be incremental - aimed at increasing
        the power of the language, giving users the ability to do
        new things, not taking away their ability to do old
        things.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">10. <em>If I produced
        my version of Shen, and it conformed to your standard in
        2011, and then you added a new feature, would I be
        required to update my implementation?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Yes; but note that we
        always make our code readable and documented, we support
        our system programmers, and we are conservative in making
        changes. for one thing, we don't want to make work for
        ourselves and our colleagues.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">11. <em>Suppose I
        created a plugin for Shen which was really cool e.g. a
        feature for enabling concurrency. Suppose you changed the
        standard for Shen to include a version of concurrency
        that made my work contravene the new standard. What would
        happen?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">We cannot do that. We
        cannot make a feature created by somebody <u>retrospectively</u>
        illegal by changing the standard in such a way that that
        feature is out of bounds. What we would do in that event,
        is make sure that our version of concurrency was invoked
        in such way as not to be inconsistent with the existence
        of your version under Shen. This is simple to do e.g. use
        different identifiers. Of course, if your feature was
        that cool you might want to offer it as part of the new
        standard. But that would be your choice.</font></p>

        copyright holder and designer is Mark Tarver. What
        happens to the project if something happens to him?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">After 2011, the work on
        Shen becomes more open and there will be an advisory
        committee on the development of Shen. Though Mark Tarver
        occupies the position of BDFL and has the final word,
        should something happen to him - death or incapacity;
        then executive decision, control of Lambda Associates,
        qilang and copyright will pass to the committee which
        will collectively assume the position of BDFL. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">13. <em>Could you tell
        me more about the committee?</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3">The committee is
        composed of people with technical knowledge that is
        useful to the development of Shen and people who have
        made a significant technical contribution - such as
        moving Shen to another platform or developing some
        significant systems application. They are selected by
        Mark Tarver on this basis and are there to give advice.
        But in the event that Mark is dead or incapacitated, they
        will elect people and make decisions based on majority
        voting with the chairman having the casting vote. The
        committee will be about six people and will be formed
        before the end of 2011.</font></p>
