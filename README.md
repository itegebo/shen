====

Shen currently runs under several languages; these are the instructions for installing under Lisp.

CLisp (Platforms/CLisp)

The CLisp platform is ready installed under Windows; to use it just click on the Shen executable.  If you are using Linux etc. you need to have a copy of CLisp running in the directory Platforms/CLisp.  Copy the contents of the KLambda directory into the CLisp directory and enter CLisp; type (load "install.lsp").  This should create an executable file which you can execute by the command

clisp.exe -M Shen.mem -q

SBCL (Platforms/CLisp)

The SBCL platform is ready installed under Windows; to use it just click on the Shen executable.  If you are using Linux etc. you need to have a copy of SBCL running in the directory Platforms/SBCL.  Copy the contents of the KLambda directory into the SBCL directory and enter SBCL; type (load "install.lsp").  This should create an executable file which you can execute by clicking on it.
